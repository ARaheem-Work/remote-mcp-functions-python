## ðŸ“¦ Installation & Setup

### 1. Install Azure Functions Extensions

Ensure you're inside your Python working directory and have the Azure Functions Core Tools installed. Then, run:

```bash
func extensions install
```

### 2. Create and Activate Virtual Environment
 
Make sure your Python virtual environment is activated before proceeding.
 
Create:
 
```bash
python -m .venv env
```
 
Activate:
 
```bash
# Example (Linux/macOS)
source venv/bin/activate
